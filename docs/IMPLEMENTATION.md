# Implementation Log

This document records completed work from [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md). Each section
corresponds to one numbered plan step and the commit that completed it.

## P0.1 — Reliable development baseline

Completed:

- Pinned Node.js 22 through `.nvmrc` and declared Node/pnpm support in
  `package.json`.
- Pinned pnpm 9.15.5 through the `packageManager` field.
- Added independent `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, and side-effect-free `build`
  scripts.
- Ignored pnpm store, coverage, Playwright, test, and build outputs.
- Documented the reproducible install and validation commands.
- Fixed pre-existing lint blockers so the lint command can enforce zero
  warnings.

Validation:

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- `pnpm run typecheck`
- `pnpm run lint`
- `pnpm run test`
- `pnpm run build`

CI uses Node.js 22. The local validation host used a newer Node.js release and
therefore emitted the expected engine warning, but all checks completed.
